*****

As a machine learning engineer, I have been learning and playing with deep
learning for quite some time. Now, after finishing all Andrew NG newest deep
learning courses in Coursera, I decided to put some of my understanding of this
field into a blog post. I found writing things down is an efficient way in
subduing a topic. In addition, I hope that this post might be useful to those
who want to get started into Deep Learning.

<br>
Alright, so let us talk about deep learning. Oh, wait, before I jump directly
talking about what a Deep Learning or a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is, I would
like to start this post by introducing a simple problem where I hope it will
give us a better intuition on why we need a (deep) neural network. By the way, together with this post I am also releasing [code on
Github](https://github.com/chrisbangun/medium-post/tree/master/Perceptron-to-DNN)
that allows you to train a deep neural net model to solve the XOR problem below.
<br>

### XOR PROBLEM
<br>
The XOR, or “exclusive or”, problem is a problem where given two binary inputs,
we have to predict the outputs of a XOR logic gates. As a reminder, a XOR
function should return 1 if the two inputs are not equal and 0 otherwise. Table
1 below shows all the possible inputs and outputs for the XOR function:
 
 |X1|X2|Output|
 |:-:|:-:|:-:|
 |1|1|0|
 |1|0|1|
 |0|1|1|
 |0|0|0|
 

Now, let us plot our dataset and see how is the nature of our data.

{% highlight python %}
def plot_data(data, labels):
    """
    argument:
    data: np.array containing the input value
    labels: 1d numpy array containing the expected label
    """

    positives = data[labels == 1, :]
    negatives = data[labels == 0, :]
    plt.scatter(positives[:, 0], positives[:, 1], 
                        color='red', marker='+', s=200)
    plt.scatter(negatives[:, 0], negatives[:, 1], 
                        color='blue', marker='_', s=200)

    positives = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]])
    negatives = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1]])
    data = np.concatenate([positives, negatives])
    labels = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0])

    plot_data(data, labels)
{% endhighlight %}

Maybe after seeing the figure above, we might want to rethink whether this xor
problem is indeed a simple problem or not. As you can see, our data is not
linearly separable, hence, some well-known linear model out there, such as
logistic regression might not be able to classify our data. To give you a
clearer understanding, below I plot some decision boundaries that I built using
a very simple linear model:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

Having seen the figure above, it is clear that we need a classifier that works
well for non-linearly separable data. SVM with its kernel trick can be a good
option. However, in this post, we are going to build a neural network instead
and see how this neural network can help us to solve the XOR problem.


### What is Neural Network?

Neural Network or Artificial Neural Network is a very good function
approximators that based loosely on the ways in which the brain is believed to
work. Figure 1 below shows the analogy between the human biological neuron and
an artificial neural network.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

Network With Biological Neural Network — image taken from cs231n.github.io
{: refdef}

<br>
Without going into too much detail on a biological neuron, I will give a
high-level intuition on how the biological neuron process an information.

Our neuron receives signals through Dendrite. This information or signals are
then passed through to the Soma or the Cell Body. Inside the cell body, all of
the information will be summed up to generate an output. When the sumed up
result reaches a threshold value, the neuron fires and the information will be
carried down through the axon, then to other connected neurons through its
synapses. The amount of signal transmitted between neurons depends upon the
strength of the connections.

The whole aforementioned flow is something that is adopted by the artificial
neural network. You can think of the dendrite as the weighted inputs based on
their synaptic interconnection in an artificial neural network. The weighted
input is then summed up together inside a ‘cell-body’ of the artificial neural
network. If the generated output is greater than the threshold unit, the neuron
will “fire” and the output of this neuron will be transferred to the other
neurons.

So, you can see that the ANN is modeled using the working of basic biological
neurons.

### So, How do this Neural Network works?

In order to know how this neural network works, let us first see a very simple
form of an artificial neural network called Perceptron.

For me, Perceptron is one of the most elegant algorithms that ever exist in
machine learning. Created back in the 1950s, this simple algorithm can be said
as the foundation for the starting point to so many important developments in
machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machine
and even deep neural networks.

So how does a perceptron works? We’ll use a picture represented in Figure 2 as
the starting point of our discussion.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Perceptron](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/perceptron.png){:height="150px" width="300px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 2. Perceptron —
[Source](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
{: refdef}


Figure 2 shows a perceptron algorithm with three inputs, x1, x2 and x3 and a
neuron unit which can generate an output value. For generating the output,
Rosenblatt introduced a simple rule by introducing the concept of *weights*.
Weights are basically real numbers expressing the importance of the respective
inputs to the output [[1](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)].
The neuron depicted above will generate two possible values, 0 or 1, and it is
determined by whether the weighted sum of each input, **∑wjxj**, *is less than
or greater than some threshold value*. Therefore, *the main idea of a perceptron
algorithm is to learn the values of the weights __w__ that are then multiplied
with the input features in order to make a decision whether a neuron fires or
not*. We can write this in a mathematical expression as depicted below:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*T9WY-gWHU3xMPlUKAJZDhg.png)
{: refdef}

Now, we can modify the formula above by doing two things: First, we can
transformed the weighted sum formulation into a dot product of two vectors, *w
(weights)* and *x (inputs)*, where w⋅x ≡ ∑wjxj. Then, we can move the threshold
to the other side of the inequality and to replace it by a new variable, called
*bias* b, where b ≡ −threshold. Now, with those modification, our perceptron
rule can be rewritten as:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*I6k5jLEitKojxpmVOy3NHw.png)
{: refdef}

Now, when we put all together back to our perceptron architecture, we’ll have a
complete architecture for a single perceptron as depicted below:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Single Perceptron](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/single-perceptron.png){:height="300px" width="460px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 3. A single layer perceptron architecture
{: refdef}


A typical single layer perceptron uses the Heaviside step function as the
activation function to convert the resulting value to either 0 or 1, thus
classifying the input values as 0 or 1. As depicted in Figure 4, the Heaviside
step function will output zero for negative argument and one for positive
argument.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Heaviside step function](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/heaviside.png){:height="300px" width="360px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 4. The shape of the Heaviside step function —
[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function)
{: refdef}

The Heaviside step function is particularly useful in classification task in
cases where the input data is [linearly
separable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_separability). However, recall
that our goal is to find a classifier that works well in a non linearly
separable data. Therefore, both a single layer perceptron and the Heaviside step
function is obviously pointless here. Later, as you’ll see in the next section,
we’ll need to have a multiple layers that consists of several perceptrons along
with a non linear activation function.

Specifically, there are two main reasons why we cannot use the Heaviside step
function —( see also my answer on
[stats.stackexchange.com](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/271701/why-is-step-function-not-used-in-activation-functions-in-machine-learning/318772#318772)):

1.  At the moment, one of the most efficient ways to train a multi-layer neural
network is by using gradient descent with backpropagation (we’ll talk about
these two methods shortly). A requirement for backpropagation algorithm is a
*differentiable activation function*. However, the Heaviside step function is
non-differentiable at x = 0 and it has 0 derivative elsewhere. This means that
gradient descent won’t be able to make a progress in updating the weights.

2.  Recall that the main objective of the neural network is to learn the values
of the weights and biases so that the model could produce a prediction as
close as possible to the real value. In order to do this, as in many
optimisation problems, we’d like a small change in the weight or bias to
cause only a small corresponding change in the output from the network.
Having a function that can only generate either 0 or 1 (or yes and no), won’t
help us to achieve this objective.

### Activation Function

The activation function is one of the most important components in the neural
network. In particular, a nonlinear activation function is essential at least
for three reasons:

* It helps the neuron to learn and make sense of something really complicated.
* They introduce nonlinear properties to our Network.
* we’d like a small change in weight to cause only a small corresponding change in
the output from the network

We’ve seen that the Heaviside step function as one example of an activation function, nevertheless, in this particular section, we’ll explore several non-linear activation functions that are generally used in the deep learning community. By the way, a more in-depth explanation of the activation function, including the pros and cons of each non-linear activation function, can be studied in these two great post written by [Avinash
Sharma](https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0)
and
[Karpathy](https://medium.com/@karpathy/yes-you-should-understand-backprop-e2f06eab496b).

#### Sigmoid Function

The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is a function that
given an input, it will generate an output in range (0,1). The sigmoid function
is written as:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![sigmoid activation function](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/sigmoid.png){:height="350px" width="350px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 5. The shape of the Sigmoid Function
{: refdef}


Figure 5 draws the shape of the sigmoid function. As you can see, it is like the
smoothed out version of the Heaviside step function. However, the sigmoid
function is preferable due to many factors, such as:

* It is nonlinear in nature.
* Instead of outputing 0 and 1, now we have a function that can give a value output 0.67. Yup, as you might guess, this can be used to represent a probability value.
* Still related to point (2), now we have our activations bound in a range, which means it won’t blow up the activations.

However, the sigmoid activation function has some drawbacks:

*The vanishing gradient*. As you can see from the preceding figure, when z, the
input value to the function, is really small (moving towards -inf), the output
of the sigmoid function will be closer to zero. Conversely, when z, is really
big (moving towards +inf), the output of the sigmoid function will be closer to


__*So what does this imply?*__


In that region, the gradient is going to be very small and even vanished. The vanishing gradient is a big problem especially in deep learning, where we stack multiple layers of such non-linearities on top of each other, since even a large change in the parameters of the first layer doesn’t change the output much. In other words, the network refuses to learn and oftentimes the time taken to train the model tend to become slower and slower, especially if we use the gradient descent algorithm.

Another disadvantage of the sigmoid activation function is that computing the
exponential can be expensive in practice. Although, arguably, the activation
function is a very small part of the computation in a deep net compared to the
matrix multiplication and/or convolution, so, this might not become a huge
problem. However, I think it is worth to mention.

#### Tanh Function

Tanh or hyperbolic tangent is another activation function that is commonly used
in deep neural nets. The nature of the function is very similar to the sigmoid
function where it squash the input into a nice bounded range value.
Specifically, given a value, tanh will generate an output value between -1 and
1.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![tanh activation function](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/tanh.png){:height="350px" width="350px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 6. The shape of the tanh function
{: refdef}


As mentioned earlier, the tanh activation function has characteristics similar
to the sigmoid function. It is nonlinear and it is bound to a certain range, in
this case (-1, 1). Also, not surprisingly, tanh shares the same drawbacks as
what the sigmoid has. It suffers from the vanishing gradient problem and as you
can see from the mathematical formula, we need to compute the exponential, which
oftentimes is computationally inefficient.

#### ReLu (Rectified Linear Unit)

Here it comes the ReLu, an activation function that was not expected to perform
better than sigmoid and tanh, yet, in practice it does! In fact, this
[lecture](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-1/) says by default, *use the
ReLU non-linearity.*

The ReLu has a very nice mathematical property in which it is very
computationally efficient. Given an input value, the ReLu will generate 0, if
the input is less than 0, otherwise the output will be the same as the input.
Mathematically speaking, this is the form of the ReLu function

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![relu activation function](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/relu.png){:height="350px" width="350px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 7. The shape of the ReLu function
{: refdef}

Now, you may ask, *“isn’t that a linear function? why do we call ReLu as a
nonlinear function?”*

First, let us first understand what a linear function is.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function) says that:

> In linear algebra, a linear function is a map *f* between two [vector
> spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) that preserves [vector
addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition) and [scalar
multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication):
>
> **f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)**
>
> **f(ax) = af(x)**

Given the definition above, we can see that *max(0, x)* is a piece-wise linear
function. It is piece-wise because it is linear only if we restrict its domain
to (−inf, 0] or [0,+inf). However, it is not linear over its entire domain. For
instance

> f(−1) + f(1) ≠f (0)

So, now we know that ReLu is a nonlinear activation function and it has a nice
mathematical property and also computationally more efficient compared to
sigmoid or Tanh. In addition, ReLu is known to be “free” from the vanishing
gradient problem. However, there is one big drawback in ReLu, which is called
the “dying ReLu”. The dying ReLu is a phenomenon where a neuron in the network
is permanently dead due to inability to fire in the forward pass.

To be more precise, this problem occurs when the activation value generates by a
neuron is zero while in forward pass, which resulting that its weights will get
zero gradient. As a result, when we do backpropagation, the weights of that
neuron will never be updated and that particular neuron will never be activated.
I highly suggest you to watch this
[lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYpoJMlgyXA&feature=youtu.be&t=20m54s)
video which has more in-depth explanation on this particular problem and how to
avoid the dying ReLu problem. Please go check it!

Oh, one more thing about ReLu that I think worth to mention. As you may notice,
unlike the sigmoid and tanh, ReLu doesn’t bound the output value. As this might
not become a huge problem in general, it can be, however, become troublesome in
another variant of deep learning model such as the Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN). Concretely, the unbounded value generated by the ReLu could make the
computation within the RNN likely to blow up to infinity without reasonable
weights. As a result, the learning can be remarkably unstable because a slight
shift in the weights in the wrong direction during backpropagation can blow up
the activations during the forward pass. I’ll try to cover more about this in my
next blog post, hopefully :)

### How does a Neural Network Predicts and Learns?

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Feedforward](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/feedforward.png){:height="400px" width="550px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 8. The Multi Layer Perceptrons
{: refdef}


The architecture depicted in Figure 8 above is called the multi-layer
perceptrons (MLP). As its name implies, in MLP, we simply stacked multiple
perceptrons into several layers. The one depicted above is a network with 3
layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. However, in the
deep learning or neural net community, people don’t call this network as three
layers neural network. Usually, we just count the number of hidden layers or
number of hidden layer along with the output layer, hence two-layers neural
network. The hidden layers simply mean neither an input nor an output layer.
Now, as you might guess, the term deep learning solely implies, we have “more”
hidden layers :).

__*So how do a neural net generates a predictions?*__

A neural network generates a prediction after passing all the inputs through all
the layers, up to the output layer. This process is called **feedforward**. As
you can see from Figure 8, we “feed” the network with the input, **x**, compute
the activation function and pass it through layer by layer until it reaches the
output layer. In supervised setting task, such as classification task, we
usually use a sigmoid activation function in the output layer since we can
translate its output as a probability. In Figure 8, we can see that the value
generated by the output layer is 0.24, and since this value is less than 0.5, we
can then said the prediction, **y_hat**, is zero.

Then, as in typical classification task, we’ll have a cost function which
measures how good our model approximate the real label is. In fact, training in
neural network simply means, **minimize the cost as much as possible**. We can
define our cost function as follows:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Mean Squared Error
{: refdef}


So the objective is to find some combination of __w’s__ and __b__ that could
make our cost __J__, as small as possible. To do this, we’ll rely on two
important algorithms which are Gradient Descent and Backpropagation.

#### Gradient Descent Algorithm

For those of you who have been doing machine learning might already know about
the gradient descent algorithm. Training a neural network is not much different
from training any other machine learning model with gradient descent. The only
notable difference would be the effect of nonlinearities in our network that
makes our cost function become non-convex.

To give a better intuition, let us assume that our cost function is a convex
function (a big one bowl) as depicted in Figure 9 below:
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Gradient Descent](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/GD.png){:height="300px" width="450px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 9. The schematic of the Gradient Descent —
[Source](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
{: refdef}

In the diagram above, the horizontal axes represent our space of parameters,
weights and biases, while the cost function, **J(w, b)** is then some surface
above the horizontal axes. The red circle depicted in the diagram above is the
original value of our cost w.r.t the weights and bias. To minimize the cost, we
now know that we have to go to the steepest path down the bowl. But the question
is, *how do we know which direction to step?* *Should we increase or decrease the
value of our parameters?* We can do a random search, but it will take quite a
long time and obviously computationally expensive.

There is a better way to find which direction we should go, in tweaking the
learnable parameters, weights and biases. Calculus teaches us that the direction
of the gradient vector, at a given point, will naturally point in the steepest
direction. Therefore, we’ll use the gradient of our cost function w.r.t our
weights and our biases.

Now, Let us simplify things by just looking the cost w.r.t the weights as
depicted in Figure 10 below:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

Figure 10. Visualization of negative and positive gradients —
[source](https://www.mathsisfun.com/gradient.html)
{: refdef}

Figure 10 pictures the value of our cost function w.r.t to the value of the
weights. You can think of the black circle above as our original cost. Recall
that the gradient of a function or a variable can be positive, zero or negative.
A negative gradient means that the line slopes downwards and vice versa if it is
positive. Now, since our objective is to minimize the cost, we then need to move
our weights in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function. This
update procedure can be written as follow:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 11. Parameters update — Gradient Descent
{: refdef}

where __α__ is a step size or learning rate and we’ll multiply this with the
partial derivative of our cost w.r.t the learnable parameters. So, what does
__α__ used for?

Well, the gradient tells us the direction in which the function has the steepest
rate, however, it does not tell us how far along this direction we should step.
Here is where we need the __α__, which is a hyperparameter that basically
control the size of our step, like, how much should we move towards a certain
direction. Choosing the right value for our learning rate is very important
since it will hugely affect two things: the speed of the learning algorithm and
whether we can find the local optimum or not (converge). In practice, you might
want to use an adaptive learning rate algorithms such as momentum, RMSProp, Adam
and so forth. A guy from AYLIEN wrote a very nice
[post](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) regarding various
optimization and adaptive learning rate algorithm.

#### Backpropagation

In the previous section, we’ve talked about the gradient descent algorithm,
which is an optimization algorithm that we use as the learning algorithm in a
deep neural network. Recall that by using gradient descent means that we need to
find the gradient of our cost function w.r.t our learnable parameters, **w**,
and **b**. In other words, we need to compute the partial derivative of our cost
function w.r.t **w** and **b**.

However, if we observe our cost function **J**, as depicted in Figure 12 below,
there is no a direct relationship between J and both **w** and **b**.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}

{: refdef}

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 12. Mean Squared Error
{: refdef}


Only if we trace back from the output layer, the layer that generates **y_hat**,
way to the input layer, we’ll see that **J** has an indirect relation with both
**w** and **b**, as shown in Figure 13 below:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Backpropagation](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/backprop.png){:height="350px" width="550px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
Figure 13. The schematic of the backpropagation
{: refdef}


Now, you can see that in order to find the gradient of our cost w.r.t both **w**
and **b**, we need to find the partial derivative of the cost with all the
variables, such as **a** (the activation function) and **z** (the linear
computation: **wx** + **b**) in the preceding layers. This is where we need a
backpropagation. Backpropagation is basically a repeated application of chain
rule of calculus for partial derivatives, which I would say, probably the most
efficient way to find the gradient of our cost **J** w.r.t to all the learnable
parameters in a neural network.

In this post, I’ll walk you to compute a gradient of the cost function __J__ w.r.t
__W2__, which is the weights in the second layer of a neural network. For
simplicity, we’ll use the architecture shown in Figure 8, where we have one
hidden layer with three hidden neurons.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Backpropagation1](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/backprop_1.png){:height="200px" width="300px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

To find the rate of change of __y_hat__ w.r.t __z2__, we need to differentiate our
sigmoid activation function with respect to __z__. Assuming we use a sigmoid activation function, we can then compute it as: 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Backpropagation2](/assets/posts/2017-12-25-From-Perceptron-to-Deep-Neural-Nets/backprop_2.png){:height="200px" width="300px"}{:class="img-responsive "}
{: refdef}

Now, once we have the value of our partial derivative J w.r.t W2, we can update
the value of our W2 using the formula shown in Figure 11 in the previous
section. Basically, we’ll perform the same computation with all the weights and biases
repeatedly until we have a cost value as minimum as possible.

### Neural Nets for Solving the XOR Problem

Great! I guess we’ve covered pretty much everything that we need to know in
order to build a neural network model, and even a deep learning model, that
would help us to solve the XOR problem.

While writing this post, I’ve built a simple neural network model with only one
hidden layers with various number of hidden neurons. The example of the network
that I used is shown in Figure 14 below. Also, I presented some decision
boundaries generated by my model with different number of neurons. As you can
see later, we can say that having more neurons will make our model become more
complex, hence creating a more complex decision boundary.

But, what would be the best choice? having more neurons or going deeper, meaning
having more layers?

Well, Theoritically, the main benefit of a very deep network is that it can
**represent very complex functions**. Specifically, by using a deeper
architecture, we can learn features at many different levels of abstraction, for
instance identifying edges (at the lower layers) to very complex features (at
the deeper layers).

However, using a deeper network doesn’t always help in practice. The biggest
problem that we will encounter when training a deeper network is the **vanishing
gradients** problem: a condition where a very deep networks often have a
gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent
unbearably slow.

More specifically, during gradient descent, as we backprop from the final layer
back to the first layer, we are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step,
and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero or, in rare
cases, grow exponentially quickly and “explode” to take very large values.

So, to wrap up this lengthy post, these are a few bullet points that would
briefly summarise it:

* The intuition, the Neural Net introduces non-linearities to the model and can be
used to solve a complex non-linearly separable data.
* Perceptron is an elegant algorithm that powered many of the most advancement
algorithms in machine learning, including deep learning.
* Intuitively, deep learning means, use a neural net with more hidden layers. Of
course, there are many variants of it, such as Convolution Neural Net, Recurrent
Neural net and so on.
* Activation function is extremely an important component in neural net and YES,
you should understand it.
* Currently, Gradient Descent with Backpropagation is the best combination that we
use to train a (deep) Neural Net.
* Having more hidden layers not necessarily improves the performance of our model.
In fact, it suffers from one well-known problem called the vanishing gradient
problem.
